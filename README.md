## :closed_lock_with_key: Authentication

Authentication is done via API keys. Sign up at https://developers.messagemedia.com/register/ to get your API keys.

Requests are authenticated using HTTP Basic Auth or HMAC. Provide your API key as the auth_user_name and API secret as the auth_password.

## :interrobang: Errors

Our API returns standard HTTP success or error status codes. For errors, we will also include extra information about what went wrong encoded in the response as JSON. The most common status codes are listed below.

#### HTTP Status Codes

| Code      | Title       | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 400 | Invalid Request | The request was invalid |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Your API credentials are invalid |
| 403 | Disabled feature | Feature not enabled |
| 404 | Not Found |	The resource does not exist |
| 50X | Internal Server Error | An error occurred with our API |
